# Ladsweb downloader

This is a set of scripts to download remote sensing products from LADSWEB/ modwebsrv
API.

We split the download into two steps:
* Retrieve file URLs
* Retrieving files

1. Retrieving URLs:
For usage:
	python3 get_urls.py -h

We need to define the product, the timespan and the region.
We define the region in the bbox.config file as:

	[REGION]	
	north = lat_north
	south = lat_sout
	east = lon_east
	west = lon_west

Dates are specified as yyyy-mm-dd

The urls are saved into a textfile named $REGION_$PRODUCT.csv

Examplary usage:
	python3 get_urls.py --region Africa --product VNP02DNB --collection 5110 --start 2019-09-01 --end 2019-09-03

Note: Calls to the API are bundled into increments of 100 days
Note: Upon error, verify that product + collection is specified correctly


2. Downloading data
The download scrip will download all urls from a file list (generated by get_urls.py). It verifies if files already have been downloaded and verifies checksums.

Example usage:
	python3 download.py --file_list Africa_CLDMSK_L2_VIIRS_SNPP.csv --folder /download/viirs/cldmsk/

Note: The script will remove urls form the file list for files that have been successfully downloaded
